__ResNet50-Enhanced Kidney Stone Detection: A Transfer Learning Approach__
---
Kidney stones, a prevalent health concern, can cause severe complications if not detected early, leading to extreme pain or life-threatening blockages. While small stones may pass through the urinary tract unnoticed, larger stones (over 5 mm) can obstruct the ureter and require medical intervention. To address the need for timely detection, this project leverages transfer learning using the ResNet50 model to predict kidney stones from CT scan images. ResNet50â€™s architecture, consisting of multiple convolutional,batch normalization, and ReLU layers, is optimized for classification tasks by introducing non-linearity and efficient feature extraction. The model was fine-tuned by replacing its final layers with fully connected layers to classify kidney stone images. The dataset comprises 1,453 images, divided into training (1,163 images), validation (290 images),and testing (346 images) sets. This approach achieved efficient and accurate predictions,demonstrating the effectiveness of transfer learning in medical image analysis and offering a promising solution for early kidney stone detection.
